## About Me

 I work as an IT Support Specialist in the thriving landscape of a prominent US manufacturing company. In the professional realm, I‚Äôm dedicated to ensuring the seamless operation of technology, assisting end-users, troubleshooting complex issues, and ensuring that the IT framework runs like a well-oiled machine. It's a role I relish (*maybe?*), an environment that constantly challenges and inspires me, and I love the daily puzzle-solving that comes with the territory.


### Beyond the Work Desk

Outside the confines of the tech world, I like to believe I am an ardent family man üòÖ <sup>(*psst! I am trying to be*)</sup>. Spending quality time with my son is one of life's greatest joys. Our shared adventures and playful explorations fuel both our creativity and the sense of wonder in our lives.

In my downtime, I find solace in the world of anime, where captivating stories and diverse-world *(isekai anyone?)* narratives often capture my imagination. Whether it's playing games, be it on mobile, PS4, or delving into text-based adventures, I enjoy the thrill of gaming and the immersive stories they offer.

A perpetual learner at heart, I am often found delving into code although I admit I am not very good at it. Whether it's learning new languages or tinkering existing ones, the world of programming allows me to create and innovate in the digital realm. Journaling or note-taking is a practice that allows me to reflect on life's experiences and reading light novels is a fascinating escape into different worlds and narratives.
