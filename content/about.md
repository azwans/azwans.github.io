## About Me

 I work as an IT tech in the thriving landscape of a well-known manufacturing company. In my professional environment, I keep technology running smoothly, support end users, troubleshoot complex issues, and keep IT infra running like a well-oiled machine. It‚Äôs a role I enjoy (maybe?), an environment that constantly challenges and inspires me, and I love the daily puzzle-solving that comes with the territory.  


### Beyond the Work Desk

Outside of the confines of the tech world, I like to think I am a passionate family man üòÖ (shhhh! I am trying). Spending time with my son is one of my life‚Äôs greatest joys. Our adventures and playful explorations together inspire both our creativity and sense of wonder in our lives. In my free time, I find solace in the world of light novels and  anime, where captivating stories and tales from different worlds (Isekai anyone?) often spark my imagination. Sometimes, I tend to enjoy the thrill of console and PC games mostly the engaging stories they provide.


I am constantly learning and can often be found immersing myself in code, although I have to admit I am not very good at it. Whether I‚Äôm learning new languages or tinkering with existing ones, the world of coding allows me to create and innovate. Other than that, I love keeping journals or writing down notes, which is a practice that allows me to plan and reflect on my life experiences.  

### Why This Website?

... is a digital sanctuary where I share my experiences, knowledge and the things that bring me joy. You‚Äôll find a mix of technology-related content, personal stories, gaming tidbits and perhaps some anime logs.

If you stumble upon this little corner of mine by chance, I hope you'll find something here that resonates with you. 

Feel free to explore and thank you for dropping by! üòÅ
